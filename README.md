# Ubuntu Image Fetcher 🖼️  
*"I am because we are"* – Ubuntu Philosophy  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Ubuntu Image Fetcher** is a Python script that embodies the spirit of Ubuntu:  
- **Community** → connecting to the global internet to fetch images.  
- **Respect** → handling errors gracefully without crashing.  
- **Sharing** → organizing images into a single directory for later appreciation.  
- **Practicality** → providing a real tool that fetches and saves images locally.  

This project extends the provided starter code to also solve **all challenge questions**.
